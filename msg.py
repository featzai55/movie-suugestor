info = """
📜 What it does:

Besides randomly picking popular (or less popular) movies from IMDb listings, this bot basically does three things:

- it searches for movies with /f
- it remembers what you liked with /l
- it saves what you'd like to watch next with /s

Then, you can:

- randomly pick movies from your watch list with the /rw command
- based on what you liked, randomly pick a recommended movie with /rr

Everything else deals with managing lists with /m.

🛠 Other commands:
/check test the integrity of bot local data
/upgrade sync data with the latest IMDb version
/git to get a link to the public repository. 

💡 How to /import:

The import function allows for liking movies en masse. It takes as argument a whitespace separated list of title Ids, such as <tt0033467 tt0056801 tt0054215 ...> and so on.

Depending on lenght, it could take a while, but you'll be notified when it's done importing.

With <latest> as an argument, you can also try to restore the latest data set if you emptied all data by mistake.

With <backup> as an argument, it will attempt to import a fixed list of movies. This is mainly for testing purposes.
